# Break-Even-Point-of-Crisis-Capitalism-and-COVID-in-India

Overview

This repository contains my research paper titled **“Break Even Point of Crisis: Capitalism and COVID in India.”**  
The paper investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed existing vulnerabilities in global and Indian capitalism, and how inequalities intensified as a result of economic and policy responses.  

Grounded in **Marxist crisis theory**, the study explores:

- How crises originate within capitalist systems  
- Why the pandemic escalated unemployment, poverty, and inequality  
- The expansion of the *industrial reserve army* in India  
- Government responses and their effectiveness  
- The rise of what scholars now call **“COVID Capitalism”**  
- Long-term structural implications for the economy  

## Core Themes

### **1. Crisis Theory & Capitalism**
The paper outlines the mechanics of capitalist crises using Marx’s analysis of:
- Overproduction  
- Falling profit rates  
- Breakdown between production and circulation  

### **2. Economic Impact of COVID-19 in India**
- India’s first-ever technical recession in 2020  
- GDP contraction of **24.4%** in Q1  
- Massive job losses and informal sector collapse  
- Increasing billionaire wealth despite widespread unemployment  

### **3. Inequality & the Reserve Army**
The pandemic dramatically increased:
- Poverty levels  
- Unemployment  
- Vulnerability of informal and young workers  
- Size of the industrial reserve army  

### **4. Government Responses**
An evaluation of:
- Lockdowns  
- Fiscal measures  
- Monetary policy  
- Atmanirbhar Bharat package  
- Limitations in planning & execution  

### **5. COVID Capitalism**
The crisis highlighted:
- Profit-over-life priorities  
- Structural inequalities  
- Gig economy precarity  
- Public health system failures  

## Key Findings

- The pandemic *deepened* pre-existing weaknesses in Indian capitalism  
- Informal workers, migrants, and youth faced disproportionate economic losses  
- Wealth inequality **accelerated**, even as millions lost jobs  
- Government support, though large, suffered structural gaps  
- Capitalism is not ending — but it is entering a phase with stronger state influence  
- The crisis offers an opportunity to redesign policies toward a more inclusive and sustainable model
